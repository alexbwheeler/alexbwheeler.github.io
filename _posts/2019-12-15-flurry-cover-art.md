*Cover art for the song 'Flurry' by C47eb*

[Listen to C47eb on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ikcvK3cd6JrXFfyVMwbHV)

## The process
Nothing is more satisfying than working on a project about something you love. I'm a big rap listener so creating cover art for a rap song is super fun.

I started the cover with a photo of  [C47eb](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ikcvK3cd6JrXFfyVMwbHV)  and a general direction, and the rest was up to me.
