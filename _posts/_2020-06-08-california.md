## Concept
The direction I was given for this project was to create artwork that was colourful and playful, but without being too childish or tacky. It was a nice change of pace, and I saw an opportunity to try a new style and challenge myself.

## Brainstorm
I brainstormed a few idea and the smoky head concept really seemed to fit the project well so I rolled with that. Felt like it perfectly represented the feeling of having your mind be somewhere else after a big night. I wanted to blend the themes of style and confidence with a head-bending, brain numbing hangover. Who can't relate? Also, the collage style had been something I wanted to try my hand at for a while and I thought it would work perfectly, and I think it turned out pretty well.

## The Process
My process is very much trial and error. First step was to find an image of someone who would fit the look and feel of the song. Mostly the clothes, since the actual person was going to be removed anyway. Then I played around with different elements to create the vibe I wanted, and ended up removing most of the elements for the sake of each one having more f an impact. Flowers to represent the classy side, plus a solo cup and beer for some not-so-subtle imagery.
