[Listen to Yours Truly on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2rFT993ScLaetNI6Kc4efq)

My direction was to create a sock pupet logo, which is a reference to the artist. I brainstormed a few different variations, which is my way of working out what I think will look good and what won't. 

## Brainstorm Sketches

After I was done brainstorming I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to do. I started my digitising the skteches, that was I can grab the best part of each and combine them together.
I actually really like the rough-around-the-edges look that first draft logos have, and this is one of my favorite parts of the whole process.

</div>

Finally, I retouched the logo Yours Truly liked the most, and paired it with some of the type that I had come up with during the brainstorm. The result is a logo that I feel is unique, interesting, and very personal to the artist at hand.
