*Cover art for the song 'My fault' by C47eb*

[Listen to C47eb on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ikcvK3cd6JrXFfyVMwbHV)

## Inspiration
My direction was to have c47eb being pickup up by a ufo. How I did that was up to me. I took some inspiration form retro UFO spotting pictures like tis one and added my own psychedelic twist.

I started the cover with a photo of [C47eb](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ikcvK3cd6JrXFfyVMwbHV)  and a general direction, and the rest was up to me.
For most project I work on I get my images from [UnSplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) because of the quality of the photography and the CC copyright policy. That was the case for this project as well.
