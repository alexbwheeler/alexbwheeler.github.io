## Sketches
Brainstorming is an essential part of my process and I almost always  sketch out a rough idea of what I want to do. Though they may not look like much, I have a vision in mind behind every rough draft. You can see I ended up going with my first idea. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and that's just how it goes.

The theme of the song is pretty clear, even from the title, so I wanted to reflect that in the artwork. Broken glass is very evocative of the feeling I wanted to convey, and a silhouette worked perfectly with it. Very happy with how this turned out, and the positive response I got from the artist and my community.
