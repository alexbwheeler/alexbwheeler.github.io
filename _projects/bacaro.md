## "I am Pizzatarian" Billboard Campaign

Campaign launched to promote Bacaro brand awareness around the Montreal area.

When I first began working on the brand, it had a more classic and old-school look, with branding that did little to differentiate it. Another designer and I worked together to update the brand with a more modern and recognizable visual identity.

## Branding

Packaging and stationary design to go along with new logo and visual identity I helped create.
