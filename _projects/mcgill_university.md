## Chancellor Day Cicle Logo

Logo design for the Chancellor Day Circle, a group founded to acknowledge the facultyâ€™s most significant supporters. Logo illustrated based on the architecture of the actual Chancellor Day Hall building, located on Peel Street Montreal. This logo was made during my design stage at McGill University in the University Advancement department creative team.
