### Chancellor Day Circle Logo

Chancellor Day Circle is a group founded to acknowledge the facultyâ€™s most significant supporters. I illustrated the logo based on the architecture of the actual Chancellor Day Hall building, located on Peel Street in Montreal. Designed during my design stage at McGill University with the University Advancement department creative team.
