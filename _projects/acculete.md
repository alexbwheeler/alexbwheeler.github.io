**Goal:** Fitness logo with two main themes: measured progress (strength of the mind) and athleticism (strength in the body).

**Process:** I started by having a conversation with Vanessa from <a href="https://www.veevee.ca/">VeeVee Creative Studio</a> about an overall vision for the brand. After getting a good idea of the direction we wanted to go, I began sketching logo concepts. I used the main values we wanted to promote (fitness + measured, data driven progress) as a foundation for the designs. I always start by designing a logo in black and white for maximum usability.

**Final Product:** After three rounds of logo drafts with the client and finalizing the icon we provided a brand guide which included an official typeface and use of colour.
