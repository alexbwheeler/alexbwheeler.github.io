<p>Brainstorming is an essential part of my process and I almost always  sketch out a rough idea of what I want to do. Though they may not look like much, I have a vision in mind behind every rough draft. You can see I ended up going with my first idea. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnâ€™t, and thatâ€™s just how it goes.</p>
