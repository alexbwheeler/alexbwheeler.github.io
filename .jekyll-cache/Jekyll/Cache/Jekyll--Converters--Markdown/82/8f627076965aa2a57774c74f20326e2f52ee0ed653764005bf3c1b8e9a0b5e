<p>I first created my logo back when I was still a student, and revamped my branding when I began to work full time as a designer. I knew I wanted something that reflected me and my personality. I ended up going with the letter â€œWâ€ because of my last name, and the original sketch was a stripe that folding over itself. This one spoke to me the most because I liked how even from the first sketch it felt alive and moving. Right away I knew it would look great animated.</p>
